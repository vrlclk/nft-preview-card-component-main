## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- How to overlay a color on an image properly
- The difference between Grid and Flexbox
- How to use the adjacent sibling combinator

### Useful resources

- [Adjacent sibling combinator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_combinator) - This was used for the SVG image that should appear on the center of the image, if the image is being hovered over or in focus.
